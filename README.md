# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Breast cancer prediction using ML models like SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with feature selection, EDA, and performance evaluation.
üß† Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using machine learning algorithms. Leveraging the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, the notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation to support early detection and diagnosis.
üìå Features
Data preprocessing: handling missing values, label encoding
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Feature selection using correlation analysis
ML models: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest
Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall
End-to-end workflow in a single Jupyter Notebook
