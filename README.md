# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on various medical features. Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, it demonstrates the full data science pipeline from preprocessing to model evaluation, making it useful for healthcare data analysis and educational purposes.
## 📊 Key Features
- Uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset**
- Complete pipeline:
  - Data loading and exploration
  - Feature selection and preprocessing
  - Model building with classifiers like:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Random Forest
  - Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Clean and interactive visualization (matplotlib / seaborn)
